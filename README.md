The objective is a simple, "instant" blog based on laravel. 

This will be 
* a very simple blog   
* based on laravel
* using tailwind
* and vue.js
* and laradock
* and mysql/maria db

Assuming a user has 
* root access to an ubuntu server v 16 or more
* a domain configured to point to the server's IP address

The user will run one command as root on the server and the site should be live and immediately usable as a blog.
